Welcome to this neuron net, that can learn 
to convert kilometers to miles!!

This is simple code allows you to train your one-neuron net by reference information such as: 1 km = 0,621371 meilen.

I didn't write comments in this code, because it was made by a short YT video, and you can understand how does this system work so fast.
