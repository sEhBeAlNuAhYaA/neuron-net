# HI EVERYONE!

Welcome to this neuron net, that can learn 
to convert kilometers to miles!!

By this code neuron net can be more understandable.

This is simple code allows you to train your one-neuron net by reference information such as: 1 km = 0,621371 meilen.

I didn't write comments in this code, because it was made by a short YT video, and you can understand so fast how does this system work.
